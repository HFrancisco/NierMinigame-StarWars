# NierMinigame-StarWars

This is a project based on the hacking minigame from Nier Automata with a Star Wars theme.

The player is the Millenium Falcon with the Tie fighters in the four corners and the Death Star in the middle as the enemies.

Just like in the Nier Minigame, the player must shoot the four Ties first so that the Death Star will be made vulnerable. 
This must be done while evading the contact of the Ties and the Death Stars shots.
